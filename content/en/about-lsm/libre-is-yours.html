=== Libre Technologies: common property of the 3rd millennium ===

The Libre Software Meeting is a unique opportunity to discover and share all the latest news from the field of Libre technologies and to enter into direct contact with development communities.

Open to the general public as much as to professionals, the LSM is a platform where everyone will find something of interest, from cutting-edge technical solutions to installing software for the home. 

= Join us in Brussels from 6th to 11th July 2013! =
