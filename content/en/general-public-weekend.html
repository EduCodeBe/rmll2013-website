==== The General Public Weekend has been for many years a place to be during the Libre Software Meeting. ====


These two days serve as an introduction to the Libre Software Meeting, and allow to meet the general public and awake newcomers to the advantages of Free Software.

This year once more, we are pleased to welcome you on Saturday, the 6th and Sunday, the 7th of July 2013 on the '''Place de la Monnaie/Muntplein''' in Brussels.

During the weekend, artists who play free music will be present, it will be possible to get technical and social books signed by their authors, and all along the day you will be able to win Framakeys, USB keys loaded with GNU/Linux and free software.
